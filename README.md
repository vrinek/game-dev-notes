As I try to learn a few good game engines,  I will be documenting my findings here for my future reference and for anyone that cares.

## Engines I will be messing around with:

* [Loom SDK](http://theengine.co/) because it looks like it has some things I value as a Rails developer (live reload, easy deployment)
* [MOAI SDK](http://getmoai.com/) because it looks like it has been created by actual professionals for professionals
* [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/) because it is dead easy to make a quick 3D prototype with physics by writing a little JavaScript

> These notes are written from my personal perspective. This means that I make some assumptions: OS X, Sublime Text and a familiarity with command line tools and coding.
